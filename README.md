# Push-Up Counter with Pose Detection

This project uses **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV** to build an intelligent push-up counter that uses **pose estimation** to track body joints and count reps in real time. It's an excellent example of how computer vision can be used in fitness and health applications.

## 📦 File Included

### `push_up_counter.py`
This single file handles everything:
- Captures webcam feed
- Detects human pose
- Monitors joint angles
- Converts elbow angle to progress percentage
- Counts reps
- Visualizes feedback

## 🧠 How the Project Works (Detailed Code Walkthrough)

### 1. Import Libraries
```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
import time
import pose as pem
```
- `cv2`: OpenCV for image processing and webcam access
- `numpy`: Used for interpolating bar height
- `time`: To measure FPS
- `pose`: A helper module (`pose.py`) that detects body pose and calculates angles

### 2. Setup Video and Variables
```python
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
pTime = 0

detector = pem.poseDetector(detectionCon=0.8)
count, dir, bar, per = 0, 0, 0, 0
```
- Open the webcam
- Initialize the pose detector with higher accuracy
- Initialize the push-up rep counter (`count`), movement direction flag (`dir`), and progress values (`per`, `bar`)

### 3. Start Webcam Loop
```python
while True:
    success, img = cap.read()
    img = cv2.resize(img, (1366, 780))
```
- Read and resize each frame to a fixed resolution

### 4. Pose Estimation and Landmark Extraction
```python
    img = detector.findPose(img, draw=False)
    lmList = detector.findPosition(img, draw=False)
```
- Detect body pose
- Extract landmarks (joint positions) as a list

### 5. Check Body Position (Legs Extended)
```python
    if (lmList[31][2] + 50 > lmList[29][2] and lmList[32][2] + 50 > lmList[30][2]):
```
- Ensure ankles are below knees (to confirm proper push-up position)

### 6. Calculate Angles
```python
        angle = detector.findAngle(img, 11, 13, 15)  # Left arm
        detector.findAngle(img, 12, 14, 16)           # Right arm
        detector.findAngle(img, 27, 29, 31)           # Left leg
        detector.findAngle(img, 28, 30, 32)           # Right leg
```
- Calculate elbow and knee angles

### 7. Convert Angle to Percentage
```python
        per = -1.25 * angle + 212.5
        per = (0 if per < 0 else 100 if per > 100 else per)
```
- Maps elbow angle to push-up progress percentage (0% up, 100% down)

### 8. Map Percentage to Bar Height
```python
        bar = np.interp(per, (0, 100), (650, 100))
```
- Converts progress to bar height on screen

### 9. Count Push-Ups
```python
        if per >= 95:
            if dir == 0:
                count += 0.5
                dir = 1
        elif per <= 5:
            if dir == 1:
                count += 0.5
                dir = 0
```
- Toggle `dir` to ensure a full push-up cycle is counted
- Adds 0.5 when going down and 0.5 when coming back up

### 10. Visual Feedback (Flipped Image)
```python
        img = cv2.flip(img, 1)
```
- Flip image like a mirror for natural orientation

### 11. Show Percentage and Bar
```python
        if (per == 100 or per == 0):
            cv2.putText(... green)
        else:
            cv2.putText(... red)
        cv2.rectangle(... bar background)
        cv2.rectangle(... bar fill)
```
- Show percentage and fill the bar according to progress

### 12. Else: Prompt to Get in Position
```python
    else:
        img = cv2.flip(img, 1)
        cv2.rectangle(... 'Take your position')
```
- Display a message if the user is not in proper pose

### 13. Display Count and FPS
```python
    cv2.rectangle(... count)
    cv2.putText(... count)

    cTime = time.time()
    fps = 1 / (cTime - pTime)
    pTime = cTime
    cv2.putText(... fps)
```
- Display total count and frame rate

### 14. Show Image
```python
    cv2.imshow("Image", img)
    cv2.waitKey(1)
```
- Display the final result with all visuals

🎥 I will be publishing a full video explaining every single line of this code. If you use this project, don't forget to mention me and fork the repo.

Feel free to improve or extend it for other exercises like squats, jumping jacks, or yoga!
